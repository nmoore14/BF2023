            Charles Reed, a 1975 graduate of Cumberland College, was an
            exceptional student leader and athlete. He came to Williamsburg from
            Jenkins, KY, where he set school records in the long jump, triple
            jump and 180 hurdles, which he still holds today.
          </p>
          <p class="body-text">
            While a student at Cumberland, Reed was awarded the T.J. Roberts
            Campus Leadership Award, among other awards he received. He was the
            co-founder and first president of the Black Student Union at
            Cumberland. The Charles Reed Track and Academic Scholarship was
            established by Cumberland in his honor. Reed earned a bachelorâ€™s
            degree in psychology from Cumberland in 1975, received the
            outstanding Alumni Award in 1979, and inducted into the UC Hall of
            Fame in 2012.

            Upon graduation from Cumberland, Reed began a five-year career with
            Bethlehem Steel Corporation in Western, Pennsylvania, involving
            various management positions. In 1980, he moved to Denver, Colorado,
            and held several managerial positions with Arco International Oil
            and Gas Corporation. In 1993, Reed formed his own company and bought
            the exclusive franchise rights to Schlotzsky's in the cities of
            Plano, Allen, and Frisco, Texas. In 2014 after over 21 years owning
            and operating 7 locations, he sold the franchise and the real
            estate. He is now a semi-retired commercial real estate owner.
